# Covid-19 in Slovenia

## Political Background

Political situation in my country in quite complicated. The population is very
polarised and our current prime minister is very divisive public figure, similar
to president Trump was in US. He too often publishes insulting tweets, accusing
"mainstream media" of bias and places loyal rather than competent people on key
positions (the latter is also true for his opponents). On the last few
parliamentary elections, the main issue (for the left voters) was how to prevent
Mr. Jan≈°a from becoming prime minister again, so people who disliked him were
willing to give votes to anyone who had chances for beating him.

## Before the Pandemic

In January, the former prime minister resigned, trying to force early elections,
since the polls were showing that majority of voters of his allies would switch
to his party. Not only that was a knife in the back of his allies, it would also
put early elections in April 2020, at the peak of the first wave.

In the beginning the situation looked pretty grim. The authorities were more
concerned in preventing panic than preparing for the pandemic, with no
proactivity.
