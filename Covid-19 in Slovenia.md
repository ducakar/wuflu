Hi,

I've been watching your channel since January and I watched almost all your
videos on covid-19. I would really thank you for your work, Informing people and
presenting the data to those who are not medical experts.

Here is my contribution, a report on situation in my country. Slovenia has been
fairly pro-active and a large antibody study was recently conducted which will
undoubtedly interest you. Unfortunately, no paper seems to be published yet, so
all data are from interviews and press conferences in Slovene media. I also
included description of situation, chronology and various statistics of covid-19
in Slovenia.

I won't be insulted if you don't present these data in any of your
videos, I know you will probably choose to wait for publication of some paper.

I too am quite sceptical of the results as mortality is very low (only about
0.15% of all infections) and there are no data to be found how the tests were
performed. I think there is possibility that many of positive results may be
false positives.

Feel free to contact me if you need any clarifications.

Keep up the great work,

Davorin Učakar

## Slovenian Survey on SARS-CoV-2 Prevalence

There was a large SARS-CoV-2 prevalence survey going on in Slovenia in the end
of April. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem any paper has been published yet.
These results were announced on press conference on Wednesday and in earlier
interviews in Slovene media:

* 3,000 people randomly selected from 300 regions, 10 from each. Uniformly
  distributed across Slovenia, no age restrictions.
* 1,368 people responded. 1,367 swabs and 1,318 blood samples taken.
* 2 positive swabs: 1 has already tested positive, 1 newly found.
* 41 positive on antibody test. This includes the 2 with positive swabs.
  65% of the remaining 39 reported at least one covid-19-related symptom.
  None of them suspected having covid-19.

There are currently 99 deaths and 1,450 people tested positive in Slovenia. We
performed 62,395 tests (not including the survey). Slovenia has population of
approximately 2.1 million.

The study was conducted by Institute for Microbiology and Immunology, University
of Ljubljana.

## Covid-19 Situation

At the beginning, like in other European countries, pandemic was not taken
seriously. It seemed the government was more concerned with preventing panic
and only acted reactively. Recommendations from NIJZ (National Institute for
Public Health, Slovenian "CDC") were aligned with WHO:
we only need hand and cough hygiene, discouraged wearing masks for
general public, 1.5m distance is enough and that the virus can only be
transmitted by symptomatic patients. I think it was already well in March when
the head of NIJZ was still repeating these claims during evening news on
the national TV.

It was gradually taken more seriously, due to pressure from public and
opposition parties that were forming a new government at that time. Open letter
from infectiologists from UKC LJ (University Medical Centre of University of
Ljubljana) on 12/3 urging to put country into lock-down was probably
pivotal. The next day the government decided to introduce some lock-down
measures and later when the new government has sworn, it enforced even more
decisive measures.

Many of the initial cases were imported from Italy as skiing is a very popular
sport among Slovenes. Several of these cases where also among doctors who
infected other staff in hospitals. One doctor from Metlika who returned from
vacation in Italy infected multiple colleagues in his health centre and also
spread the disease into a nearby elderly home he was visiting, hence Metlika
became the first hotspot in Slovenia. NIJZ's recommendation at that time was
that those coming from Italy, even hotspots, can safely go to work if they don't
have any symptoms.

There were also several reports in media that people had trouble getting tested.
According to NIJZ's recommendations only ones coming from hotspots AND
having symptoms should be tested. There were two stories in media of persons
who were only tested after lot of persistence and then they tested positive.
The testing later increased to about 1,200 per day and about half of that during
weekends and holidays. It continues at that same peace till today.

With the new government the infectiologists from UKC LJ were appointed to lead
the measures instead of NIJZ, which was being criticised by the leading party
in the new government. Infectiologists introduced a new testing
regime as the number of patients increased: there was less contact tracing,
they focused on hospitalised patients.

Between 6/3 and 13/3 there was roughly 50% daily increase in confirmed cases.
After the new testing regime, between 16/3 and 27/3 there was about 9% daily
increase. After that date, exponential growth stopped. This is about 11-13
days of delay from introduction of lock-down measures (closure of schools, bars
and restaurants, public transportation stopped).

Situation was the worst in elderly homes. About 10% of all elderly homes in
Slovenia reported covid-19 cases, some were very badly hit (Šmarje pri Jelšah,
Ljutomer, Metlika). It seems they initially got instructions from NIJZ that
asymptomatic patients are not infective and they only need to isolate
symptomatic ones.

Interestingly, we have more fatalities among females. That's because there were
by far the most fatalities in elderly homes, where females represent much larger
proportion of residents. On 4/5 there were 97 total covid-19-related
fatalities, 78 of those were elderly home residents. 10 of them died in
hospitals, other 68 died in their elderly homes.

Is seems we have currently mitigated the epidemic pretty well. Today's R₀ is 0.5
based on [this estimate](https://pacs.zf.uni-lj.si/shinyR/apps/projects/CoronaSim/).

At the beginning of the epidemic we had 168 ventilators in Slovenia (population
of about 2.1 million). Currently we have around 400 and some more are being
delivered.

## Chronology

* 4/3: First infection in Slovenia.
* 6/3: Visits in elderly homes forbidden.
* 7/3: Gathering of more than 500 people forbidden.
* 10/3: Controls on Italian border, gathering of more than 100 people in
  closed spaces forbidden.
* 12/3: Infectiologists from UKC LJ (University Medical Centre in Ljubljana)
  urge government to put country into lock-down. Epidemic declared in Slovenia.
* 13/3: New government.
* 14/3: The new government seems not to trust NIJZ; infectiologists from UKC LJ
  appointed to lead the group to battle covid-19 and propose measures.
  New testing regime, less contact tracing, infectiologists say they will
  estimate prevalence based on hospitalisations;
  we are now if phase 2: contact tracing not feasible, need lock-down.
  Public transport stopped, first fatality.
* 16/3: Schools, universities and kindergartens closed. Non-essential stores
  closed. Supermarkets larger than 4000 m² closed. Pubs, bars, restaurants
  closed. Non-urgent medical services stopped. Only urgent automobile repairs
  allowed.
* 19/3: Head of NIJZ, criticised by the new government, removed.
* 20/3: All gatherings forbidden. Mandatory disinfections in apartment buildings
  (elevators, door handles ...).
* 30/3: Movement limited to municipalities. Only allowed to leave municipality
  you live in if you go to work, to a doctor, helping others or farming. This
  came as a response to many people going to trips around the country and fear
  of them spreading the virus. This measure was pretty controversial, annoyed
  many people and was publicly criticised by vice-head and then leading
  epidemiologist of NIJZ.
* 4/4: 8:00-10:00 and the last hour of stores' working time reserved for
  vulnerable groups: elderly (65+), pregnant women, invalids ... Mandatory masks
  and gloves in all closed public spaces (e.g. stores) and 2m distance between
  persons. Only one family member can go to a store at once. Stores install
  plastic shields around registers, clerks must wear masks and gloves too.
* 20/4: Non-essential stores open, mechanics (fully) open, certain
  non-individual sports allowed: tennis, golf, lawn balls. Gloves not mandatory
  any more, disinfectant must be available in stores and other public places.
* 21/4: IMI (Institute for Microbiology and Immunology of University of
  Ljubljana) started National survey for SARS-CoV-2 prevalence.
* 25/4: NIJZ council voted for a new head. Unlike his predecessors, he's not
  epidemiologist but a drug addiction expert and was proponent of strict
  lock-down measures.
* 27/4: National holidays, Day of Resistance against Occupation. Anti-government
  protests, hundreds of protesters gathering in front of parliament in
  Ljubljana, some smaller protests were also in other cities. Most of them were
  not wearing masks or keeping the distance. They were protesting against
  limiting civil liberties, lock-down measures and (alleged) corruption during
  PPE purchases.
* 30/4: Restriction of movement to municipalities lifted.
* 2/5: All samples for SARS-CoV-2 prevalence survey collected.
* 4/3: Large supermarkets, hairdressers, cosmetic salons, pubs, restaurants etc.
  open. In bars/restaurants, guests are only allowed outside, on terraces,
  there must be enough distance between tables etc.
* 8/5: New anti-government protests. About 5,500 protesters driving with bikes
  around parliament in Ljubljana, several hundreds in other cities.
* 11/5: Public transport will start again. 1.5m distance between passengers
  recommended, only allowed to sit on designated seats.
* 18/5: Kindergartens will open, schools will open for final years and first 3
  years of elementary school.

## Political Situation

You are probably wondering why so many anti-government protests. Slovenian
society is strongly divided by their political views. Unfortunately, this is
also true for many (most) journalists, judges, experts ... The currently largest
political party and its leader, current prime minister, is deeply hated by
majority of people who identify as left.

At the beginning of the crisis there was big shortage of PPE and ventilators,
so panic buying started, which was even more chaotic due to government switch.
We were victim of several scams: two occasions of trucks with PPE "disappearing"
(two turned out to not exist and one re-routed to a different customer).
Wrong/less suitable PPE was ordered, some prices were too high, companies that
never handled medical equipment were selected to deliver it, known Slovenians
offering their help, often though companies where their relatives were employed
... Strategic reserve leadership is now blaming government for putting pressure
on them, favouring certain suppliers and contracts.

This all turned into a big blame game between opposition accusing government of
corruption and war profiteering, and government accusing the former government
(most parties now in opposition) for bleak response to the epidemic and leaving
strategic reserve almost without PPE (actually, strategic reserve leadership
says the old government discouraged them from haste PPE purchases, told them to
"stop panicking").

This PPE/ventilator corruption allegations, hatred and distrust towards the
leading government party and people annoyed by lock-down measures resulted in
several anti-government protests in the last two weeks with more scheduled.
Many people see NPI measures too harsh and think the government is
using the situation for introduction of dictatorship and hence must be ousted
before it's too late. Slovenia has not been hit hard by epidemic, so people
claiming covid-19 being "just a flu" or a hoax have became very vocal lately,
especially after the results of the antibody study have been presented.
Many are convinced other countries are fabricating their numbers and the virus
is not nearly as dangerous as presented in media, but rather used as an excuse
for power and money grab by the elites and the current Slovenian government is
part of this scheme.

Majority of people, though, act responsibly and follows the rules and
recommendations from government and NIJZ.
